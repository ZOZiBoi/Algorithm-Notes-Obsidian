- characterized as *tight bound* on asymptotic behavior
- says that **functions grows precisely at a certain rate**
- rate of growth function bound within a constant factor from above and below
- if you can show that a function is both $O(f(n))$ and $Ω(f(n))$ then you have shown that the function is $Θ(f(n))$
