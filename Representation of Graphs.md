You can represent a graph in two ways $G = (V, E)$
1. As a collection of [[adjacency lists]]
2. As an [[adjacency matrix]]

For **sparse** graphs - $|E|$ is much less than $|V|^2$ - an adjacency list provides a compact way to represent the graph

For **dense** graphs - $|E|$ is close to $|V|^2$ - adjacency matrix
