- only works in **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**
- begin with a selected node 
- do a [[Depth First Search|DFS]] exploring only unvisited node
- on the recursive callback of the [[Depth First Search|DFS]], add current node to the topological ordering in reverse order.

Start from node H, arbitrarily 
![[Pasted image 20241221034508.png]]
Keep going until you reach deadend
![[Pasted image 20241221034601.png]]
Backtrack from deadend
![[Pasted image 20241221034628.png]]
Add M (the deadend) to the last element to the topological ordering 
Keep going until all nodes are visited
